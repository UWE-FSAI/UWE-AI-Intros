# UWE-AI-Intros
Write your name, and tell us your best (worst) programming joke

If you don't remember how to clone a git repository, go to the green "Code" button, and copy the https:// URI

Run the following in your terminal:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/UWE-FSAI/UWE-AI-Intros.git
cd UWE-AI-Intros

```

To make a branch use `git branch <Your name>` and `git checkout <your name>`

Open the new directory (folder) in your favourite code editor

Once you've written (and saved) your joke, remember to `git add ` the file

Then run `git commit -m "<your commit message>"` and `git push --set-upstream origin <your branch name>`
